                <p>Egies as cultural symbols are used to hold power to influence society, continuing with how cultural symbols and ideas can promote ideas. These egies are symbols of the peopleâ€™s sentiments, orreflections of their environment. Such symbolism is considered a powerful tool to communicate.</p>

                    <h4>Graffiti &amp; Vandilism</h4>
                    <p>Graffiti can be also a form of protest as they are the most exposed in the common masses. These can be found in public areas where people are mostly found casting a call to a much wider audience. They can be considered as a form of anarchic expression, as their messages often question the ones in power</p>
